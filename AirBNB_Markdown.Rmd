## Main Objectives

The objective is to answer the question: Is it more advantageous to keep current properties and rent it out, or should the property be sold, considering current trends?

In order to answer this question, there are multiple angles that need to be considered, including, but not limited to:

-   The demographic trend (race, age, class, etc.) of the areas surrounding the properties

-   The demographic of the renter + home buyer market

-   The return on investment (ROI) of the current properties

-   The housing market trend of the areas surrounding the properties
